We'll cover some of the toolkits available, such as Express, Hydra, and Seneca, and create a simple microservice. Introduce you to continuous integration using Mocha to add a test suite, we'll use chai to test the HTTP interface, and we'll use nyc to see the test coverage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Advanced Node.js Development</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This book is packed with a ton of content, projects, challenges, and real-world examples, all designed to teach you Node by doing. This means you'll be getting your hands dirty early on in the upcoming chapters writing some code, and you'll be writing code for every project. You will be writing every line of code that powers our applications. Now, we would require a text editor for this book.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Practical Node.js Building Real-World Scalable  Web Apps</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Practical Node.js: Building Real-World Scalable Web Apps is a hands-on manual for developing production-ready web applications and services by leveraging the rich ecosystem of Node.js packages. This is important because real applications require many components, such as security, deployment, code organization, database drivers, template engines, and more.\nPractical Node.js is a one-stop place for getting started with Express.js 4, Hapi.js, DerbyJS, Mongoskin, Mongoose, Everyauth, Mocha, Jade, Socket.IO, TravisCI, Heroku, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and many other technologies. Most of these are vital for any serious project.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Node.js 8 the Right Way</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Building robust Node.js applications and making use of the extensive Node.js ecosystem. Using realistic applications from several different domains, it gives a highly useful and thorough description of the process of building, testing, and deploying real-world Node.js programs. Cover about sockets, robust microservices and more.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>RESTful Web API Design with Node.js 10 (3er Edition)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This book covers: REST, Getting Started with Node.js, implementing, preparing, consuming a RESTful API.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>REST API Development with Node.js</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p> This book will cover REST, API development, and, finally, how these two mix up with Node.js. The final chapters will be 100% practical, going over a real-world example of a RESTful API developed in Node.js. </p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Express in Action</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This books aims to teach you everything about Express.js, the web framework that makes te powerful Node.js easy to use.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Nodejs Design Pattern","keywords":"nodejs"},"excerpt":"Node.js Books List of some books about Node.js Description about each book List: Hands-On Microservices with Node.js This book is an end-toâ€¦"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/node/books-list/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","4202924991"]}
